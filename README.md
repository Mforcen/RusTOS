# RusTOS

> A Real Time Operating System in Rust for Cortex M3 embedded systems.

This project aims to be a fully working operating system.

Some of the planned features are:
- Create a multitasking operating system by using threads.

- Embed a Lua interpreter to execute programs without flashing the whole firmware.

- Provide a dynamic memory manager to be used in the programs.

- Provide an abstraction layer to work with file systems, network stacks and peripherals through the use of drivers.

- Provide POSIX inspired APIs for Rust programs.

- Add a shell to control and monitor the status of the operating system.
